# fig_gadgets

A small grab-bag of Flutter UI widgets and effects we've built and reused across internal projects.

We know – it's not modular, not perfect, and certainly not production-polished. But maybe you'll find something useful.  
If one widget here saves you five minutes of tinkering, that's already a win.

We accept no responsibility for beauty, structure, or long-term support.  
That said, feel free to use, fork, or send a PR if you fix something cool. ✌️
